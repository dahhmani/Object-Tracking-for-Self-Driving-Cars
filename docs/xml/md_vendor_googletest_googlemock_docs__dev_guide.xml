<para>If you are interested in understanding the internals of Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref>, building from source, or contributing ideas or modifications to the project, then this document is for you.</para><para><heading level="1">Introduction</heading>
</para><para>First, let&apos;s give you some background of the project.</para><para><heading level="2">Licensing</heading>
</para><para>All Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> source and pre-built packages are provided under the <ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">New BSD License</ulink>.</para><para><heading level="2">The Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> Community</heading>
</para><para>The Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> community exists primarily through the <ulink url="http://groups.google.com/group/googlemock">discussion group</ulink>, the <ulink url="https://github.com/google/googletest/issues">issue tracker</ulink> and, to a lesser extent, the <ulink url="../">source control repository</ulink>. You are definitely encouraged to contribute to the discussion and you can also help us to keep the effectiveness of the group high by following and promoting the guidelines listed here.</para><para><heading level="3">Please Be Friendly</heading>
</para><para>Showing courtesy and respect to others is a vital part of the Google culture, and we strongly encourage everyone participating in Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> development to join us in accepting nothing less. Of course, being courteous is not the same as failing to constructively disagree with each other, but it does mean that we should be respectful of each other when enumerating the 42 technical reasons that a particular proposal may not be the best choice. There&apos;s never a reason to be antagonistic or dismissive toward anyone who is sincerely trying to contribute to a discussion.</para><para>Sure, C++ testing is serious business and all that, but it&apos;s also a lot of fun. Let&apos;s keep it that way. Let&apos;s strive to be one of the friendliest communities in all of open source.</para><para><heading level="3">Where to Discuss Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref></heading>
</para><para>As always, discuss Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> in the official <ulink url="http://groups.google.com/group/googlemock">Google C++ Mocking Framework discussion group</ulink>. You don&apos;t have to actually submit code in order to sign up. Your participation itself is a valuable contribution.</para><para><heading level="1">Working with the Code</heading>
</para><para>If you want to get your hands dirty with the code inside Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref>, this is the section for you.</para><para><heading level="2">Checking Out the Source from Subversion</heading>
</para><para>Checking out the Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> source is most useful if you plan to tweak it yourself. You check out the source for Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> using a <ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</ulink> client as you would for any other project hosted on Google Code. Please see the instruction on the <ulink url="../">source code access page</ulink> for how to do it.</para><para><heading level="2">Compiling from Source</heading>
</para><para>Once you check out the code, you can find instructions on how to compile it in the ../README.md &quot;README&quot; file.</para><para><heading level="2">Testing</heading>
</para><para>A mocking framework is of no good if itself is not thoroughly tested. Tests should be written for any new code, and changes should be verified to not break existing tests before they are submitted for review. To perform the tests, follow the instructions in <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/source/browse/trunk/README">README</ulink> and verify that there are no failures.</para><para><heading level="1">Contributing Code</heading>
</para><para>We are excited that Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> is now open source, and hope to get great patches from the community. Before you fire up your favorite IDE and begin hammering away at that new feature, though, please take the time to read this section and understand the process. While it seems rigorous, we want to keep a high standard of quality in the code base.</para><para><heading level="2">Contributor License Agreements</heading>
</para><para>You must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before we can accept any code. The CLA protects you and us.</para><para><itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>If you are an individual writing original source code and you&apos;re sure you own the intellectual property, then you&apos;ll need to sign an <ulink url="http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html">individual CLA</ulink>.</para></listitem><listitem><para>If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work to Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref>, then you&apos;ll need to sign a <ulink url="http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html">corporate CLA</ulink>.</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
</para><para>Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it.</para><para><heading level="2">Coding Style</heading>
</para><para>To keep the source consistent, readable, diffable and easy to merge, we use a fairly rigid coding style, as defined by the <ulink url="https://github.com/google/styleguide">google-styleguide</ulink> project. All patches will be expected to conform to the style outlined <ulink url="https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/cppguide.xml">here</ulink>.</para><para><heading level="2">Submitting Patches</heading>
</para><para>Please do submit code. Here&apos;s what you need to do:</para><para><orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Normally you should make your change against the SVN trunk instead of a branch or a tag, as the latter two are for release control and should be treated mostly as read-only.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Decide which code you want to submit. A submission should be a set of changes that addresses one issue in the <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/issues/list">Google Mock issue tracker</ulink>. Please don&apos;t mix more than one logical change per submittal, because it makes the history hard to follow. If you want to make a change that doesn&apos;t have a corresponding issue in the issue tracker, please create one.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Also, coordinate with team members that are listed on the issue in question. This ensures that work isn&apos;t being duplicated and communicating your plan early also generally leads to better patches.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Ensure that your code adheres to the Google Mock source code style.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Ensure that there are unit tests for your code.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Sign a Contributor License Agreement.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Create a patch file using <computeroutput>svn diff</computeroutput>.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>We use <ulink url="http://codereview.appspot.com/">Rietveld</ulink> to do web-based code reviews. You can read about the tool <ulink url="https://github.com/rietveld-codereview/rietveld/wiki">here</ulink>. When you are ready, upload your patch via Rietveld and notify <computeroutput>googlemock@googlegroups.com</computeroutput> to review it. There are several ways to upload the patch. We recommend using the <ulink url="../scripts/upload_gmock.py">upload_gmock.py</ulink> script, which you can find in the <computeroutput>scripts/</computeroutput> folder in the SVN trunk.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
</para><para><heading level="2">Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> Committers</heading>
</para><para>The current members of the Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> engineering team are the only committers at present. In the great tradition of eating one&apos;s own dogfood, we will be requiring each new Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> engineering team member to earn the right to become a committer by following the procedures in this document, writing consistently great code, and demonstrating repeatedly that he or she truly gets the zen of Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref>.</para><para><heading level="1">Release Process</heading>
</para><para>We follow the typical release process for Subversion-based projects:</para><para><orderedlist>
<listitem><para>A release branch named <computeroutput>release-X.Y</computeroutput> is created.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Bugs are fixed and features are added in trunk; those individual patches are merged into the release branch until it&apos;s stable.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>An individual point release (the <computeroutput>Z</computeroutput> in <computeroutput>X.Y.Z</computeroutput>) is made by creating a tag from the branch.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Repeat steps 2 and 3 throughout one release cycle (as determined by features or time).</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Go back to step 1 to create another release branch and so on.</para></listitem></orderedlist>
