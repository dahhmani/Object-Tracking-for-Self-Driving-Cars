</para><para>When you write a prototype or test, often it&apos;s not feasible or wise to rely on real objects entirely. A <bold>mock object</bold> implements the same interface as a real object (so it can be used as one), but lets you specify at run time how it will be used and what it should do (which methods will be called? in which order? how many times? with what arguments? what will they return? etc).</para><para><bold>Note:</bold> It is easy to confuse the term <emphasis>fake objects</emphasis> with mock objects. Fakes and mocks actually mean very different things in the Test-Driven Development (TDD) community:</para><para><itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><bold>Fake</bold> objects have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut (perhaps to make the operations less expensive), which makes them not suitable for production. An in-memory file system would be an example of a fake.</para></listitem><listitem><para><bold>Mocks</bold> are objects pre-programmed with <emphasis>expectations</emphasis>, which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.</para></listitem></itemizedlist>
</para><para>If all this seems too abstract for you, don&apos;t worry - the most important thing to remember is that a mock allows you to check the <emphasis>interaction</emphasis> between itself and code that uses it. The difference between fakes and mocks will become much clearer once you start to use mocks.</para><para><bold>Google C++ Mocking Framework</bold> (or <bold>Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref></bold> for short) is a library (sometimes we also call it a &quot;framework&quot; to make it sound cool) for creating mock classes and using them. It does to C++ what <ulink url="http://www.jmock.org/">jMock</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.easymock.org/">EasyMock</ulink> do to Java.</para><para>Using Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> involves three basic steps:</para><para><orderedlist>

</para><para>In contrast, Java and Python programmers have some fine mock frameworks, which automate the creation of mocks.

It is your friend if any of the following problems is bothering you:</para><para><itemizedlist>

</para><para>Let&apos;s look at an example. Suppose you are developing a graphics program that relies on a LOGO-like API for drawing. How would you test that it does the right thing? Well, you can run it and compare the screen with a golden screen snapshot, but let&apos;s admit it: tests like this are expensive to run and fragile (What if you just upgraded to a shiny new graphics card that has better anti-aliasing? Suddenly you have to update all your golden images.). It would be too painful if all your tests are like this. Fortunately, you learned about Dependency Injection and know the right thing to do: instead of having your application talk to the drawing API directly, wrap the API in an interface (say, <computeroutput>Turtle</computeroutput>) and code to that interface:</para><para><programlisting><codeline><highlight class="normal">class<sp/>Turtle<sp/>{</highlight></codeline>

It&apos;s that simple! Once you get the hang of it, you can pump out mock classes faster than your source-control system can handle your check-ins.</para><para><bold>Tip:</bold> If even this is too much work for you, you&apos;ll find the <computeroutput>gmock_gen.py</computeroutput> tool in Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref>&apos;s <computeroutput>scripts/generator/</computeroutput> directory (courtesy of the <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/cppclean/">cppclean</ulink> project) useful. This command-line tool requires that you have Python 2.4 installed. You give it a C++ file and the name of an abstract class defined in it, and it will print the definition of the mock class for you. Due to the complexity of the C++ language, this script may not always work, but it can be quite handy when it does. For more details, read the <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/source/browse/trunk/scripts/generator/README">user documentation</ulink>.</para><para><heading level="2">Where to Put It</heading>
</para><para>When you define a mock class, you need to decide where to put its definition. Some people put it in a <computeroutput>*_test.cc</computeroutput>. This is fine when the interface being mocked (say, <computeroutput>Foo</computeroutput>) is owned by the same person or team. Otherwise, when the owner of <computeroutput>Foo</computeroutput> changes it, your test could break. (You can&apos;t really expect <computeroutput>Foo</computeroutput>&apos;s maintainer to fix every test that uses <computeroutput>Foo</computeroutput>, can you?)</para><para>So, the rule of thumb is: if you need to mock <computeroutput>Foo</computeroutput> and it&apos;s owned by others, define the mock class in <computeroutput>Foo</computeroutput>&apos;s package (better, in a <computeroutput>testing</computeroutput> sub-package such that you can clearly separate production code and testing utilities), and put it in a <computeroutput>mock_foo.h</computeroutput>. Then everyone can reference <computeroutput>mock_foo.h</computeroutput> from their tests. If <computeroutput>Foo</computeroutput> ever changes, there is only one copy of <computeroutput><ref refid="class_mock_foo" kindref="compound">MockFoo</ref></computeroutput> to change, and only tests that depend on the changed methods need to be fixed.</para><para>Another way to do it: you can introduce a thin layer <computeroutput>FooAdaptor</computeroutput> on top of <computeroutput>Foo</computeroutput> and code to this new interface. Since you own <computeroutput>FooAdaptor</computeroutput>, you can absorb changes in <computeroutput>Foo</computeroutput> much more easily. While this is more work initially, carefully choosing the adaptor interface can make your code easier to write and more readable (a net win in the long run), as you can choose <computeroutput>FooAdaptor</computeroutput> to fit your specific domain much better than <computeroutput>Foo</computeroutput> does.</para><para><heading level="1">Using Mocks in Tests</heading>

</para><para>The first clause we can specify following an <computeroutput>EXPECT_CALL()</computeroutput> is <computeroutput>Times()</computeroutput>. We call its argument a <bold>cardinality</bold> as it tells <emphasis>how many times</emphasis> the call should occur. It allows us to repeat an expectation many times without actually writing it as many times. More importantly, a cardinality can be &quot;fuzzy&quot;, just like a matcher can be. This allows a user to express the intent of a test exactly.</para><para>An interesting special case is when we say <computeroutput>Times(0)</computeroutput>. You may have guessed - it means that the function shouldn&apos;t be called with the given arguments at all, and Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> will report a Google Test failure whenever the function is (wrongfully) called.</para><para>We&apos;ve seen <computeroutput>AtLeast(n)</computeroutput> as an example of fuzzy cardinalities earlier.

</para><para>Remember that a mock object doesn&apos;t really have a working implementation? We as users have to tell it what to do when a method is invoked. This is easy in Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref>.</para><para>First, if the return type of a mock function is a built-in type or a pointer, the function has a <bold>default action</bold> (a <computeroutput>void</computeroutput> function will just return, a <computeroutput>bool</computeroutput> function will return <computeroutput>false</computeroutput>, and other functions will return 0). If you don&apos;t say anything, this behavior will be used.</para><para>Second, if a mock function doesn&apos;t have a default action, or the default action doesn&apos;t suit you, you can specify the action to be taken each time the expectation matches using a series of <computeroutput>WillOnce()</computeroutput> clauses followed by an optional <computeroutput>WillRepeatedly()</computeroutput>. For example,</para><para><programlisting><codeline><highlight class="normal">using<sp/>::testing::Return;...</highlight></codeline>

</programlisting></para><para>This says that <computeroutput>turtle.GetX()</computeroutput> will be called <emphasis>exactly three times</emphasis> (Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> inferred this from how many <computeroutput>WillOnce()</computeroutput> clauses we&apos;ve written, since we didn&apos;t explicitly write <computeroutput>Times()</computeroutput>), and will return 100, 200, and 300 respectively.</para><para><programlisting><codeline><highlight class="normal">using<sp/>::testing::Return;...</highlight></codeline>

</programlisting></para><para>says that <computeroutput>turtle.GetY()</computeroutput> will be called <emphasis>at least twice</emphasis> (Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> knows this as we&apos;ve written two <computeroutput>WillOnce()</computeroutput> clauses and a <computeroutput>WillRepeatedly()</computeroutput> while having no explicit <computeroutput>Times()</computeroutput>), will return 100 the first time, 200 the second time, and 300 from the third time on.</para><para>Of course, if you explicitly write a <computeroutput>Times()</computeroutput>, Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> will not try to infer the cardinality itself. What if the number you specified is larger than there are <computeroutput>WillOnce()</computeroutput> clauses? Well, after all <computeroutput>WillOnce()</computeroutput>s are used up, Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> will do the <emphasis>default</emphasis> action for the function every time (unless, of course, you have a <computeroutput>WillRepeatedly()</computeroutput>.).</para><para>What can we do inside <computeroutput>WillOnce()</computeroutput> besides <computeroutput>Return()</computeroutput>? You can return a reference using <computeroutput>ReturnRef(variable)</computeroutput>, or invoke a pre-defined function, among others.</para><para><bold>Important note:</bold> The <computeroutput>EXPECT_CALL()</computeroutput> statement evaluates the action clause only once, even though the action may be performed many times. Therefore you must be careful about side effects. The following may not do what you want:</para><para><programlisting><codeline><highlight class="normal">int<sp/>n<sp/>=<sp/>100;</highlight></codeline>
<codeline><highlight class="normal">EXPECT_CALL(turtle,<sp/>GetX())</highlight></codeline>
<codeline><highlight class="normal">.Times(4)</highlight></codeline>
<codeline><highlight class="normal">.WillOnce(Return(n++));</highlight></codeline>
</programlisting></para><para>Instead of returning 100, 101, 102, ..., consecutively, this mock function will always return 100 as <computeroutput>n++</computeroutput> is only evaluated once. Similarly, <computeroutput>Return(new Foo)</computeroutput> will create a new <computeroutput>Foo</computeroutput> object when the <computeroutput>EXPECT_CALL()</computeroutput> is executed, and will return the same pointer every time. If you want the side effect to happen every time, you need to define a custom action, which we&apos;ll teach in the CookBook.</para><para>Time for another quiz! What do you think the following means?</para><para><programlisting><codeline><highlight class="normal">using<sp/>::testing::Return;...</highlight></codeline>
<codeline><highlight class="normal">EXPECT_CALL(turtle,<sp/>GetY())</highlight></codeline>
<codeline><highlight class="normal">.Times(4)</highlight></codeline>
<codeline><highlight class="normal">.WillOnce(Return(100));</highlight></codeline>
</programlisting></para><para>Obviously <computeroutput>turtle.GetY()</computeroutput> is expected to be called four times. But if you think it will return 100 every time, think twice! Remember that one <computeroutput>WillOnce()</computeroutput> clause will be consumed each time the function is invoked and the default action will be taken afterwards. So the right answer is that <computeroutput>turtle.GetY()</computeroutput> will return 100 the first time, but <bold>return 0 from the second time on</bold>, as returning 0 is the default action for <computeroutput>int</computeroutput> functions.</para><para><heading level="2">Using Multiple Expectations</heading>
</para><para>So far we&apos;ve only shown examples where you have a single expectation. More realistically, you&apos;re going to specify expectations on multiple mock methods, which may be from multiple mock objects.</para><para>By default, when a mock method is invoked, Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> will search the expectations in the <bold>reverse order</bold> they are defined, and stop when an active expectation that matches the arguments is found (you can think of it as &quot;newer rules override older ones.&quot;). If the matching expectation cannot take any more calls, you will get an upper-bound-violated failure. Here&apos;s an example:</para><para><programlisting><codeline><highlight class="normal">using<sp/>::testing::_;...</highlight></codeline>
<codeline><highlight class="normal">EXPECT_CALL(turtle,<sp/>Forward(_));<sp/><sp/>//<sp/>#1</highlight></codeline>
<codeline><highlight class="normal">EXPECT_CALL(turtle,<sp/>Forward(10))<sp/><sp/>//<sp/>#2</highlight></codeline>
<codeline><highlight class="normal"><sp/><sp/><sp/><sp/>.Times(2);</highlight></codeline>
</programlisting></para><para>If <computeroutput>Forward(10)</computeroutput> is called three times in a row, the third time it will be an error, as the last matching expectation (#2) has been saturated. If, however, the third <computeroutput>Forward(10)</computeroutput> call is replaced by <computeroutput>Forward(20)</computeroutput>, then it would be OK, as now #1 will be the matching expectation.</para><para><bold>Side note:</bold> Why does Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> search for a match in the <emphasis>reverse</emphasis> order of the expectations? The reason is that this allows a user to set up the default expectations in a mock object&apos;s constructor or the test fixture&apos;s set-up phase and then customize the mock by writing more specific expectations in the test body. So, if you have two expectations on the same method, you want to put the one with more specific matchers <bold>after</bold> the other, or the more specific rule would be shadowed by the more general one that comes after it.</para><para><heading level="2">Ordered vs Unordered Calls</heading>
</para><para>By default, an expectation can match a call even though an earlier expectation hasn&apos;t been satisfied. In other words, the calls don&apos;t have to occur in the order the expectations are specified.</para><para>Sometimes, you may want all the expected calls to occur in a strict order. To say this in Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> is easy:</para><para><programlisting><codeline><highlight class="normal">using<sp/>::testing::InSequence;...</highlight></codeline>

<codeline><highlight class="normal">}</highlight></codeline>
</programlisting></para><para>By creating an object of type <computeroutput>InSequence</computeroutput>, all expectations in its scope are put into a <emphasis>sequence</emphasis> and have to occur <emphasis>sequentially</emphasis>. Since we are just relying on the constructor and destructor of this object to do the actual work, its name is really irrelevant.</para><para>In this example, we test that <computeroutput>Foo()</computeroutput> calls the three expected functions in the order as written. If a call is made out-of-order, it will be an error.</para><para>(What if you care about the relative order of some of the calls, but not all of them? Can you specify an arbitrary partial order?

</para><para>Now let&apos;s do a quick quiz to see how well you can use this mock stuff already.

</programlisting></para><para>Suppose <computeroutput>turtle.GoTo(0, 0)</computeroutput> is called three times.

Now, since we said that there should be only two such calls, Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> will report an error immediately. This is basically what we&apos;ve told you in the &quot;Using Multiple Expectations&quot; section above.</para><para>This example shows that <bold>expectations in Google <ref refid="class_mock" kindref="compound">Mock</ref> are &quot;sticky&quot; by default</bold>, in the sense that they remain active even after we have reached their invocation upper bounds.

</programlisting></para><para>If you think it says that <computeroutput>turtle.GetX()</computeroutput> will be called <computeroutput>n</computeroutput> times and will return 10, 20, 30, ..., consecutively, think twice!

So, the second time <computeroutput>turtle.GetX()</computeroutput> is called, the last (latest) <computeroutput>EXPECT_CALL()</computeroutput> statement will match, and will immediately lead to an &quot;upper bound exceeded&quot; error - this piece of code is not very useful!</para><para>One correct way of saying that <computeroutput>turtle.GetX()</computeroutput> will return 10, 20, 30, ..., is to explicitly say that the expectations are <emphasis>not</emphasis> sticky.

</programlisting></para><para>And, there&apos;s a better way to do it: in this case, we expect the calls to occur in a specific order, and we line up the actions to match the order.
